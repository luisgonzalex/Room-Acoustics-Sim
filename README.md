# Room-Acoustics-Sim
## MIT MISTI 2019 Room acoustics simulation algorithm 
The followings are code samples from my research experience at Universidad de Alcala in Madrid, Spain.
The package pyroomacoustics was used in order to perform an acoustic simulation, and matplotlib was used to provide visual representations for the simulations.
